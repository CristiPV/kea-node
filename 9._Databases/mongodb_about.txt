MongoDB: collections <=> MySQL: tables

collection:
[
    {
        key: "value"
    }
]

[
    {
        team: "Arsenal",
        players: []
    },
    {
        profit: 123445
    }
]

Use MySQL:
 - when you have a rigid schema
    * when you want it to fail at the database level if you don't adhere to the schema
 - when you have many relations

Use MongoDB:
 - when you don't have a fixed schema
 - when you don't mind duplicating data ( no relation support )
 - great for rapid prototyping
 - great for simple application
 - great sharding and clustering support

Beware:
° A lot of handling for MongoDB happen in the application layer; you can really mess °
° things up easily with MongoDB. MongoDB depends on the programmer being good rather °
° than the database being well-designed and allowing for "bad" programmers to use it.°

Would you ever combine MySQL with MongoDB ?
